    <h3>Instructions</h3>

        <li>Pat thawed shrimp dry with paper towels; add to a large mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>Combine rice flour, paprika, salt, and cayenne pepper in a small bowl; sprinkle over shrimp and toss until completely coated using a large spoon or spatula.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add shrimp in a single layer, in batches, and cook until browned and just barely cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Add some garlic butter; cook for 30 seconds more. Repeat with remaining shrimp and garlic butter. Serve immediately.</li>
