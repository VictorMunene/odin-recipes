    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>
        1 cup whole wheat flour <br>
        1 cup all-purpose flour <br>
        1/2 teaspoon salt <br>
        1 cup water <br>
        2 tablespoons vegetable oil <br>
    </p>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <p>Gather all ingredients. <br>
        Mix whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, and salt in a large bowl. Use a wooden spoon to stir in water and oil. Mix until a soft, elastic dough forms and add more water, if needed. <br>
        Knead dough on a lightly floured surface until smooth. Cover with a damp cloth and let rest for 30 minutes. <br>
        Divide dough into 12 equal parts and roll into balls. Roll each ball into a thin circle. <br>
        Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place a chapati on the skillet and cook until bubbles form, and the dough is no longer raw, about 2 minutes. <br>
        Flip and cook the other side. <br>
        Serve warm.
