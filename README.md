# odin-recipes
In the course of this project, I managed to create four pages; one being the homepage, which consists of three different links to three pages each consisting of recipes to some of my personal favorite dishes. 
Each of the pages is made up of a purely html page which consists of an image of how the dish looks when ready, followed by a brief description of the meal, then an unordered list of the ingredients, then an ordered list of the steps to preparing the meal and finally a link that takes a user back to the homepage which has the links to the three different recipes. 
Over this project, I have managed to refresh and put my skill learned over the past few classes to the test and create a meaningful page.
